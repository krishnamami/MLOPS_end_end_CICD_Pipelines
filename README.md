# MLOPS End to End Implementation with CI/CD Piplenies on Jenkins on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

ðŸš€ End-to-End MLOps Pipeline using Jenkins on GCP

This project demonstrates a complete MLOps workflowâ€”from raw data ingestion to model deploymentâ€”leveraging CI/CD pipelines powered by Jenkins and hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It showcases best practices in building scalable, automated, and reproducible ML systems.


## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
- Automate ML pipeline from data ingestion to model deployment
- Use Jenkins to orchestrate CI/CD workflows
- Containerize and deploy ML models using Docker and Google Cloud Run
- Learn key concepts of MLOps, experiment tracking, and continuous training
  
## ðŸ§  Use Case: Hotel Booking Optimization
The model solves key problems in the hotel industry:
- **Revenue Management**: Handle overbookings and predict cancellations
- **Targeted Marketing**: Personalized ad targeting based on user behavior
- **Fraud Detection**: Identify suspicious booking patterns
