# MLOPS End to End Implementation with CI/CD Pipelines using Jenkins on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

🚀 End-to-End MLOps Pipeline using Jenkins on GCP

This project demonstrates a complete MLOps workflow—from raw data ingestion to model deployment—leveraging CI/CD pipelines powered by Jenkins and hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It showcases best practices in building scalable, automated, and reproducible ML systems.


## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Automate ML pipeline from data ingestion to model deployment
- Use Jenkins to orchestrate CI/CD workflows
- Containerize and deploy ML models using Docker and Google Cloud Run
- Learn key concepts of MLOps, experiment tracking, and continuous training
  
## 🧠 Use Case: Hotel Booking Optimization
The model solves key problems in the hotel industry:
- **Revenue Management**: Handle overbookings and predict cancellations
- **Targeted Marketing**: Personalized ad targeting based on user behavior
- **Fraud Detection**: Identify suspicious booking patterns

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies Used

|Category| Tools/Tech Used |
|--------|-------------|
| Data Storage	| Google Cloud Storage (GCS) |
| Model Training | Python, LightGBM, Scikit-learn |
| Tracking | MLflow |
| CI/CD | 	Jenkins, Git, Docker |
| Deployment | Google Cloud Run, Container Registry|
| App Layer | Flask (for prediction API) |

🔧 CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)
- Jenkins installed inside Docker container
- Pulls project repo from GitHub
- Sets up virtual environment & dependencies
- Builds and pushes Docker image to Google Container Registry (GCR)
- Deploys container to Google Cloud Run using service account credentials

✅ Key Features
- Modular Codebase for reusability and testing
- Fully Automated Deployment through Jenkins pipeline
- Experiment Tracking with MLflow for better model governance
- Flask App for serving predictions
